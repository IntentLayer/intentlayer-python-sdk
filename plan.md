# Gateway Integration Enhancement Plan

This document outlines the plan to address the feedback on the Auto-DID Gateway implementation.

## Initial Implementation (2023-05-01)

1. âœ… **Replace Placeholder Stub with Real Implementation**
   - Added proto files to project and set up protoc integration
   - Created Makefile target for protoc generation and CI check for stale stubs
   - Replaced placeholder with real gateway_pb2_grpc.GatewayServiceStub
   - Added tests for proto serialization/deserialization roundtrip

2. âœ… **Fix Schema Fields**
   - Updated DidDocument class to include all fields required by V2 proto
   - Added proper field validation with detailed error messages
   - Implemented proper to_proto/from_proto conversion methods
   - Ensured all fields are correctly passed to the gateway stub

3. âœ… **Secure JWT Verification**
   - Implemented tiered approach for JWT validation (prod/test/dev environments)
   - Made signature verification mandatory in production
   - Added detection and rejection of unsafe algorithms
   - Added tests for JWT verification in all environment tiers
   - Enhanced error reporting for validation failures

4. âœ… **Rate-Limit Cache Improvement**
   - Replaced unbounded error log timestamps dictionary with cachetools.TTLCache
   - Made cache thread-safe with proper locking
   - Added proper TTL for cache entries (1 hour)
   - Implemented graceful fallback when cachetools is not available

   - [ ] Enhance thread safety in _rate_limited_log by wrapping the entire function
   - [ ] Make JWT unsafe algorithm handling consistent across all environment tiers

4. ðŸ”´ **V1 Protocol Deprecation & Cleanup** (Owner: TBD, Target: 2023-05-06)
   - [ ] Remove or archive all V1-only code, contracts, and tests
   - [ ] Update all documentation to reflect V2-only support
   - [ ] Remove V1 compatibility layers in client code
   - [ ] Add deprecation notices where appropriate

5. ðŸ”´ **Documentation & Version Updates** (Owner: TBD, Target: 2023-05-07)
   - [ ] Update README.md to reflect V2-only protocol support
   - [ ] Bump SDK version to 0.5.0 in pyproject.toml
   - [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md entry documenting the breaking change
   - [ ] Document new Makefile targets and proto generation process
   - [ ] Update API references and example code

6. ðŸ”´ **CI Enforcement** (Owner: TBD, Target: 2023-05-08)
   - [ ] Create GitHub Actions matrix for Linux, macOS, and Windows
   - [ ] Add CI job that runs `make proto && pytest` on all platforms
   - [ ] Add CI check that V1 code has been properly removed/archived
   - [ ] Ensure all new tests run on all supported platforms

## Remaining Tasks (Post Production)

### Phase 2: Testing & Code Quality

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] Create lightweight in-process gRPC server for testing
- [ ] Add request/response handling tests with real proto messages
- [ ] Add CI job for integration testing with actual stubs

- [ ] Test certificate expiry handling
- [ ] Test invalid certificate formats
- [ ] Test CA append vs. replace functionality
- [ ] Test failure scenarios and fallback behavior

#### Code Refactoring
- [ ] Extract retry loop to dedicated helper class
- [ ] Move error-mapping logic to separate module
- [ ] Extract TLS/certificate handling to utility class
- [ ] Refactor register_did into smaller methods
- [ ] Improve overall class organization

### Phase 3: Security & Clean-up

#### Sensitive Logging
- [ ] Define sensitive fields whitelist/blacklist
- [ ] Add linter rule or script to detect sensitive logging
- [ ] Implement redaction for DIDs, tokens, etc.
- [ ] Add hooks for SIEM integration

#### Dead Code Removal
