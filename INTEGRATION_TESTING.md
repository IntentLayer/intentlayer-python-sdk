# IntentLayer SDK Integration Testing

## Overview

This document outlines the approach used for integration testing in the IntentLayer Python SDK, focusing on the Gateway service client.

## Integration Testing Strategy

We've implemented an integration testing strategy that verifies the Gateway client's functionality without requiring actual network connections:

1. **Mock-based Integration Tests**:
   - Created robust mock implementations of gRPC stubs
   - Configured responses to match real-world scenarios
   - Tested success and error handling paths

2. **Test Coverage Areas**:
   - Basic DID registration functionality
   - Error handling (including specific error types)
   - Metadata and API key handling
   - Multiple consecutive operations

3. **CI Integration**:
   - Added dedicated workflow for integration tests
   - Separated concerns from unit tests
   - Configured code coverage reporting

## Running the Tests

To run the integration tests locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install --extras grpc
poetry add grpcio-testing --group dev

# Run the mock integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/gateway/test_mock_integration.py -v
```

## Future Enhancements

For future work on integration testing, we recommend:

1. **In-Process gRPC Server**:
   - Implement a lightweight in-process gRPC server
   - Use grpc_testing module for full request/response handling
   - Test actual proto message serialization/deserialization

2. **More Comprehensive Scenarios**:
   - Add tests for more complex retry scenarios
   - Test edge cases around timeouts and reconnections
   - Add tests for streaming operations

3. **Test Environment**:
   - Create a dockerized test environment
   - Use a real gRPC server in CI for true end-to-end testing
   - Add load/performance testing for the client

## Implementation Notes

The initial attempt at creating an in-process gRPC server was complex due to:

1. Differences in grpc_testing module APIs between versions
2. Complexity of setting up proper channel and stub mocking
3. Difficulties in handling error conditions realistically

The current approach using mock stubs provides a good balance between:
- Test coverage and reliability
- Implementation complexity
- Execution speed

We can revisit the in-process gRPC server approach in the future if more sophisticated testing is needed.
